<h1> Mapping Equitable and Inclusive AI: A Cross-Institutional Research and Curricular Initiative</h1>

<div id="map"></div>


<div class="map-info">
  <h2>  Equitable and Inclusive AI Curricular Innovation and Research Initiative</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to develop cross-institution professional and research opportunities
for graduate students and faculty at both Morgan State and University at Buffalo that focus
specifically on building Equitable and Inclusive AI. These opportunities will provide students
with an expanded network of professional mentors, unique localized research opportunities
across institutions, and a broad cross-institution of cohort-based professional development
and community of practice. Additionally, this project aims to expand and innovate curricula
that integrates principles of equity and inclusion within AI studies.</p>

    <h3>Justice and Equity in Technology Policy course on Coursea , University Of Michigan</h3>      <img src="./U-M_Logo-Hex.png" alt="George Washington University Logo">
</div>
  <p>The Justice and Equity in Technology Policy course on Coursera, offered by the University of Michigan, explores how technology and policies can reinforce inequities, particularly affecting marginalized communities. It focuses on topics like algorithmic bias, AI design, and the politics of innovation, urging learners to rethink power dynamics in tech development and policymaking.
Key themes include the role of social values in shaping technology, the importance of inclusive policies, and addressing biases in regulation. Led by experts like Virginia Eubanks and Shobita Parthasarathy, the course provides micro-credentials and examines intersections between AI, equity, justice, and DEI, offering tools to advocate for more equitable systems.
